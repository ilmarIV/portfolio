        <h4>Year: 2025</h4>
        <p>This project involved developing a landing-page style website for a company in the sawmill industry. The website was built using React and Bootstrap, and was deployed using the Zone hosting service. In addition to the public-facing site, the project included the development of an admin panel, allowing the client to easily update page content and manage images.</p>
        <h4>My Role:</h4>
        <p>I was primarily responsible for design and testing. I created interactive prototypes and focused on the UI/UX design of the website to ensure a user-friendly experience. Additionally, I conducted manual testing and produced relevant documentation to support project delivery and handover.</p>
